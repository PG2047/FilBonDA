# FilBonDA
Lending and bond products for the Filecoin market, based on the FVM



## Say “Hi”  to fil community 


The FilDA project is a lending platform founded in 2021. It runs and deploys on multiple chains. The peak value of TVL exceeds 1 billion US dollars, and it is currently 20 million US dollars. The existing contract code has been audited by 6 auditing companies for many times. It has operated smoothly in many times of major market shocks and has not incurred bad debts.

We very much agree with the vision of FIL and are very optimistic about the market prospect of FIL. Therefore, we hope that when FVM goes online, we can simultaneously open the FIL lending market and provide DeFi services for miners and FIL holders.



## What's the FilBonDA?

FilBonDA is a smart contract account through which you can hold various assets and interests, even if these assets and interests are not transferable (SBT? aha), as long as they have recognized value, it can issue "bonds" for itself , to create credit. FilDA can issue loans for them.

As we all know, Filecoin nodes pledge a large number of valuable FIL assets, but they are all locked by the Owner account and cannot be moved. The traditional Compound lending model cannot solve this problem because it is based on an overcollateralization model. FilBonDA is here to solve this problem.

For the Filecoin miner, the miner can host the owner account of the node to the FilBonDA, use the existing sector pledge as the source of credit, and create a credit line. When the account has a loan amount, FilDA can provide it with a loan .

The miner is still the Admin of the FilBonDA, and he still has control over the node. The biggest difference from before is that he will check the amount of his loan when withdrawing money, and every time he withdraws money, he must ensure that the collateral assets in the account are greater than the loan.



## How to work?

FilDA will launch a lending market on FVM, and all FIL holders can deposit FIL into FILDA on the Filecoin network. And miners can convert their accounts to FilBonDA so that they can borrow from FilDA. Based on the terms of the smart contract, miners cannot escape, all borrowing is based on the sector pledge of the account, and all loans can only continue to be used for additional sector pledges. So the deposited FIL is safe. At the same time, as long as the miner repays the loan, he can switch the Owner at any time and leave FilBonDA, and his node is still his.

## Value to Filecoin Ecology

As far as I know, only 20% of FIL participates in staking mining, and the remaining 80% do not have much usage scenarios. The Filecoin Plus plan will become mainstream in the future, and 10x rewards also mean 10x pledges. How can miners and FIL holders unite to participate in the development of the Filecoin network? This is the value of FilBonDA.



## What's the next? Layer 2 of Fliecoin!

At present, the main computing power comes from proof of storage space. In the future, Filecoin will store more valuable data. These valuable data are the future of Filecoin. For these data, it should not only be saved by one node, but by 5 or even 10 nodes.
The current data should not only be written but not read. Filecoin should have better read and write capabilities in the future.

We have been paying attention to the Filecoin community, and these problems are also the main topics in the current community. We also want to contribute to solving these problems.

We hope to establish a node alliance, and all Filecoin Plus data will be stored by multiple nodes in this alliance, so as to back up each other. If necessary, at least among the members of the alliance, they can read each other's data and help each other restore their backups. If this alliance can be established, all files stored by this alliance are extremely safe, because it has multiple backups and can be restored at any time. If based on such data as collateral, FilDA can give more borrowing lines, because we can guarantee the safety of mortgage FIL to the greatest extent. Even FIL depositors are willing to provide loans with lower interest rates, because asset safety is more important than high returns.

To sum up, we hope that FilBonDA can develop a "layer 2" network in the second stage. Nodes joining this network will perform multiple backups for Filecoin Plus data and provide data access interfaces. The rewards for joining this two-layer network can be obtained Borrow more and at lower cost.
